This project is based on the premise that, at any given point in the season, the league
table does not tell the complete story. For example, couple of months into the season a
team might be 6th on the table, but has played all its difficult games, whereas a team
might be 1st on the table, but has played only easy games until then.

This project is an attempt to look at the league table in a different perspective.
It takes into account the fact that different games have different difficulty levels
and attemplrs to create a table that is more performance based.

We call this the Performance Index table. It takes into account the difficulty of playing
a top team and also the difficulty in playing away vs home. There are lot more factors that
can be taken into account. However, for now these two important factors are considered.
